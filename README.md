# Diabetes Prediction using Multiple Machine Learning Models

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical attributes using multiple machine learning algorithms. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and comparison.

## üìå Objectives

- To preprocess and analyze the diabetes dataset
- To implement and compare the performance of multiple ML models
- To identify the most effective model for accurate diabetes prediction

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost

## üìä Workflow

1. **Data Collection** - Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (or any other)
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
4. **Feature Selection**
5. **Model Building**
6. **Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC**
7. **Model Comparison & Conclusion**

## üîç Results

A detailed performance comparison of models is included in the notebook to determine the most effective approach for diabetes prediction.
